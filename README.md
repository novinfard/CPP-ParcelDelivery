# Parcel delivery cost calculation

A Courier company provides a number of delivery options within the UK, each with specific cost associated. Standard parcel delivery cost is calculated as £2.6 per kg. Two day delivery option adds a flat fee £4 on top of the standard delivery price and Next day delivery option adds an additional £3.5 per kg on top of the standard delivery price.
This program calculates the cost of parcel delivery. I have considered the inheritance hierarchy in my design.

Notes:
- Parcel information includes name, address, city, and postcode for both sender and recipient.
- Data validation is considered.
- Header file, source code file and main program is separated
- Class encapsulation and information hiding is considered
- Appropriate data types is used
